            For this week progress, focused in trying the templates and
            wordpress in locally environment. Although there is some problem
            surfaced, but it solved. Below is the detail for this week report.
          </p>

        <div class="mt-6 prose prose-indigo prose-lg text-gray-500 mx-auto">
          <h2>Achievement :</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Initialize wordpress 5.7.2 (latest) locally.</li>
            <li>Init stack themes too locally (Variant Version).</li>
            <li>Import and preview demo.</li>
            <li>Test drive themes to get the grasp of it.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Problem Found :</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>MerlinWP error after install Stack themes.</li>
            <li>Some plugins error such as WP Less, Ebor Megamenu.</li>
            <li>Some block error in Variant page builder.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            By the time this report was done, all the problem has been fixed.
            The root cause is because of the latest version of PHP which is
            PHP8. So to conclude, the themes did not support the PHP8, so the
            local environment backwarded to PHP7. Thats the end of the report.
